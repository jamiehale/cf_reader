# Channel File Reader

Reads binary channel files generated by Flaw 5.1 and outputs a YAML version. Crashes in a variety of different ways if the file is malformed.

## Usage

    cf_reader.rb [--verbose] <filename>
    
    --verbose	Outputs logging info useful for finding errors in either the
                code or the channel file.

## Development

Requires Ruby 2.2+ (although it will probably run just fine in older versions).
